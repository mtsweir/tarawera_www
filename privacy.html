				<p>The Internet offers the chance to collect information about site users. This information can be personally identifiable information or aggregated information. However your privacy is important to us at Tarawera Publishing Limited and we want to be sure that you understand the terms and conditions relating to the way in which we collect information and the use of that information. This Privacy Policy tells you what information we collect, what we do with it and your rights to view, correct or change it.</p>
				<p>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner <a href="http://www.privacy.org.nz" rel="nofollow">www.privacy.org.nz</a> provides further details of the New Zealand Privacy Act and how it protects personal information in New Zealand.</p>
				<h2>The Information That We Collect</h2>
				<p><strong>As part of our operations we may gather certain types of information about the users of our sites:</strong></p>
				<h6>1. Personally Identifiable Information</h6>
				<p>This is provided by you when you register for services that we may offer. Examples of these services could include email newsletters or competitions.

				<h6>2. Aggregated Data</h6>
				<p>Aggregated Data. This information is generated by our systems as they track traffic through our sites. This information does not identify you personally and is not linked to the personally identifiable information that you may have provided.</p>

				<p><strong>We will not share the information that we collect with any third parties apart from in the following circumstances:</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>The information may be hosted with a service provider. Our agreements with them protect the information that we collect from any use by them that we have not authorised.</li>
					<li>The aggregated data (not the personally identifiable information) may be shared with third parties such as advertisers, statistic agencies or business partners.</li>
					<li>Your personally identifiable information may be shared with third parties when we believe in good faith that we are required to do so by law.</li>
					<li>If we have asked your prior permission (which we would usually do at the time of collection), we may share the information with specified third parties.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>What Else We Do With The Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
				<p>We have collected this information in order to provide the best possible service to you while you are visiting our sites. To this end we may use the information that you provide for the following purposes:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>To verify your identity if you need help with a forgotten password or you are having login problems with one of our site services.</li>
					<li>To process any transactions that you might make on our site.</li>
					<li>To help provide any other services that you have requested.</li>
					<li>To offer the most relevant information suitable to your and your interests.</li>
					<li>For any marketing, promotional, publicity, direct marketing or market research that we might undertake.</li>
					<li>For any other purposes for which you have given permission.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>What About Cookies?</h2>

					<li>Allow you to enter certain site member services without having to log in each time you visit.</li>
